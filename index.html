                <i>So you've found my website! Let me introduce myself...</i>
                <br><br>
                My name is Jacob and I'm currently a fourth year student at McMaster University working towards my Bachelor of Technology. 
                In terms of engineering, I like to consider myself a jack-of-all-trades. I enjoy a good mixture of hardware designing, building electrical circuits, and business management problems. 
                But with my background in back-end programming, I've really taken a liking to the controls engineering aspect of the program. 
                I've loved learning to program PLCs and FANUC robots, and I'm looking forward to seeing what my last year has in store for me!
                <br><br>
                Feel free to send me an email or a message on LinkedIn, I'd love to connect with you!
